Functions that need to be added:

additional functions that could be implemented:

\/ need to write logging libraries.

Customizable Output Formats:

    JSON/XML Output:
        --output-format <json|xml>: Format the output as JSON or XML.
    Custom Templates:
        --output-template <template>: Use a custom template for the output.

Detailed Statistics Logging:

    Extended Logging:
        --log-file <file>: Specify a file to log detailed information about each ping attempt.
        --log-format <format>: Specify the format of the log file, e.g., text, CSV.
    Graphical Output:
        --graph-output <file>: Generate a graphical representation of the ping results and save it to the specified file.


\/ need to write error handling libraries.

Advanced Error Handling:

    Error Classification:
        --verbose-errors: Display categorized and detailed error messages.
    Retry Logic:
        --retry <count>: Number of retry attempts for failed pings.
        --retry-interval <interval>: Interval between retry attempts.

now this, I can do!

Integration with Other Network Tools:
    DNS Diagnostics:
        --dns-lookup: Perform DNS resolution checks and display DNS lookup times.

Enhanced Timing and Scheduling:

    Scheduled Pings:
        --schedule <cron_expression>: Schedule pings to run at specified times.
    Adaptive Interval:
        --adaptive-interval: Automatically adjust the ping interval based on network conditions.

Custom Packet Payloads:

    Payload Content:
        --payload <data>: Specify custom content for the ping packet payload.
    Variable Payload Size:
        --vary-payload: Vary the packet size during the ping session to test different MTU sizes.

Multi-Host and Multi-Interface Support:

    Batch Ping:
        --batch <file>: Specify a file containing a list of hosts to ping.
    Multi-Interface Ping:
        --interfaces <interface1,interface2,...>: Send pings from multiple network interfaces concurrently.

Geolocation Information:

    Geolocation Lookup:
        --geolocation: Display geolocation information for the target IP address.


\/ how about NO? this is going to be a pain to implement.
Alerting and Notifications:

    Threshold-Based Alerts:
        --alert-threshold <latency|packetloss>:<value>: Set thresholds for latency or packet loss and trigger alerts.
    Real-Time Notifications:
        --notify <method>: Specify the method of notification (e.g., email, SMS) for significant events.
